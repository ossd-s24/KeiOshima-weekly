## Group project progress report deciding on a project

This week, we decided to do pandas for our open-source project. One of our group members did a project evaluation on it and said that it looked friendly to beginner contributors. Furthermore, two of us are familiar with using it. Our first steps were to install a development environment and try and join the Slack community.

I was able to set up the development environment but faced issues along the way. Two of the four methods did not work for me, but one eventually did. Our team has decided to first contribute to documentation issues to establish ourselves within the Pandas community and hopefully get in contact with some main contributors to get a more significant issue to work on.
