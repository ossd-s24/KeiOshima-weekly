## thoughts origins of free/open source and the people

The origin of open-source software is amazing. While it is not a very interesting origin story, the fact that it all started because Richard Stallman and his colleagues could not modify a printer makes it more special when we see what open source is today. The fact that so many of the tools we as programmers use are open source derived from being unable to modify a printer is extraordinary. In terms of the people, some of these people are very interesting. Reading Linues messages and realizing this was the man who created Linux was very funny. Besides Linus, the FOSS person my partner and I looked at was Guido von Rossum, the creator of the Python language. His minimalistic website contained an audio recording of how to say his name, which was a short 4-second clip, which left me more confused than before about how to say his name.

## project progress 

Our team has not decided on a definitive project, but we will focus on projects using Python, as everyone agreed. Regarding possible candidates, our team is considering working on either pandas or danswers. However, danswer's first-time issues are large implementations for their products, given how recent their product is. We will decide on a project by wednesday.
