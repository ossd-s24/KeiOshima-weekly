## Group project progress report 

In the last few weeks, my team has decided to use pandas for our open-source project. The first major challenge our team faced was actually setting up a development environment. We all had trouble with each method of creating the development environment. However, by reaching out to the community they have on Slack, we were able to resolve the issues. After setting up the dev environment, we collectively decided to contribute to some documentation issues first.

 Due to some unforeseen circumstances, I'm still working on the issue, but I will hopefully get it done soon. Besides that, we got an opportunity to meet and talk with some main contributors to teh pandas project through their weekly dev meetings and were assigned a possible task we could look into.
