## git exercises

The git activity was an excellent way to brush up on git skills. I usually use git through the command line, so I was familiar with the commands. Although I initially ran into some issues, like trying to create an SSH key, I opted to use HTTPS instead. 


## browser extension

My team has made good progress on the browser extension. We have an established idea of what the extension should look like and how it should work. Our team's extension is a website blocker in which users can add a list of websites they want to block. Since I am more comfortable with the backend, my contributions have been more backend-focused. I've made initial styling using HTML and CSS and set up the partial backend for one of the tabs in our browser extension (retrieving the website URL and website icon). One of my other teammates has edited my designs and finished the other ones for the other tab.

It is nice to work with teammates who are more comfortable with the front end than I am. I'm learning a lot about design and the practicality of tools like Figma, so that's a good thing that is happening. So far, we have yet to face any challenges. The only challenge I see is implementing the full blocking site functionality and having it persist for the user.
