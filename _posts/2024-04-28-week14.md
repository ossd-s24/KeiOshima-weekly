## Open Source Beyond Software

It was refreshing to see open source in a light outside of just purely software, considering it's the only lens I've been looking at for teh last three weeks. It reminds you of how open source, in one way or another, is a part of your life. For example, my favorite soda coca, Coca-Cola ingredients soda, is under lock and unavailable to the public and even to most employees. To fix this, open-source cola provides a more commercial recipe for Coca-Cola to other people. 
In addition, projects like Free Beer are blogs that post open-source recipes for beer. Both these projects still embody the open-source principle of collaboration adn teamwork to navigate towards a single goal or ideal. Overall, it was refreshing to see open source in other fields unrelated to software.

## Group project progress

Regarding group projects, our team has begun discussing what we want to include in our presentation and who will take what part. Through a team effort, one of the maintainers closed one of the documentation issues we were working on. There are two more other doc issues, and we can hopefully close those as well.
