## This week's presentation

Overall, I enjoyed this week's presentation. It was interesting to see all the different ways people interacted with the community and the types of issues they worked on. For example, the free code camp group worked on a mix of documentation, forum posting, design, and general coding contributions. At the same time, some groups contributed ot translating documentation issues and code refactoring. My favorite group presentation was Godot. I could tell how invested they were in the project, and it was exciting for me to learn more about game design software as it is something I've never really touched before. Besides Godot, I think Spiceify did an excellent job in their contribution. I have never used themes for my Spotify before, but after that presentation, I will definitely look into not only that group's theme but other themes as well.

Our group has finalized our presentation and finished making our contributions to the panda's project. We spent time this week practicing going over it, but there were still some things that needed ot be addressed that we will finish today.
