## Comment about group work 

Overall, I think the group work for the browser extension was a success. We produced a product that I think my teammates and I were satisfied with. I learned that I think I like working in teams, especially since my term had a diverse set of skills. For example, one of my teammates was more comfortable with frontend and designing the UI. This gave me more time to focus on the backend, which I was grateful for. In terms of working in a team, I think I work pretty well with others.

## My contribution 

Besides setting up the initial part of grabbing the icon and URL, I also finished implementing the blocking feature that one of my other templates started in, which has our background script interact with our content script to rewrite and block the website. In addition, I edited the readme, code of conduct, and contribution as well.

## New things I learned 

I got more comfortable using javascript to interact with the browser directly. Most of the JavaScript I have used has been in the context of web development to display a page or do some functionality behind the scenes but never really in front of me like this. 

## Other teams presentation 

I think my favorites were Tylerify and TikTock extension. The tylerify made me laugh a lot which i appreciate. The TikTock extension is one that I see myself using.
